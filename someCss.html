		<h1>Nhi Nguyen</h1>
		<h2>A Little Bit About Myself...</h2>
		<p>My name is Nhi. It rhymes with knee. I am from Seattle, but was originally born in Vietnam. I moved to the U.S. when I was just 3 years old. I like to eat, cook, listen to music, bike, watch tv shows, photography, etc. When I was in middle school I was a breakdancer. I actually won 2nd place as a little 6th grader in a competition called "Iron Leg" which is performing footwork as long as I can.</p>
		<p><font size="5">I am 20 years old. My birthday is January 13, 1997. Every time I am asked to state an interesting fact about myself for ice breakers and etc. I will usually say that I was born on Friday the 13th because the 13th falls on a Friday sometimes and for some reason I assumed that I was born on one, but I recently found out that January 13, 1997 was a Monday. Oops.</font></p>
